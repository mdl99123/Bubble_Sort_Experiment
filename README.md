This program compares the performance between the bubble sort algorithm
and a modified bubble sort algorithm which attempts to shorten the number of cycles
required to run the bubble sort algorithm

The theory being tested is that by executing multiple comparisons and swaps in a single
cycle rather than doing one comparison and swap per cycle will reduce the cycles need to 
execute the program and reduce as well the amount of time needed to run the sorting algorithm

Results:
The modified bubble sort's Cycles were reduced significantly. Time to run was faster a few times but not most of the time.
